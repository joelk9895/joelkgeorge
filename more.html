                    <h3>I was born in March 4th 2003 in Kundara Kerala.</h3>
                    <h3>My family migrated to Delhi after I was born.</h3>
                    <h3>I was at Delhi for about a year.</h3>
                    <h3>We then came back to Kerala when I was one and half years old.</h3>
                    <h3>I am not boasting but my mother used to say that I was a fast learner.</h3>
                    <h3>I joined SNGCS at the age of 4.</h3>
                    <h3>I had a interest for science and math from my childhood.</h3>
                    <h3>I was eager to know about space</h3>
                    <h3>When I was at 8th standard I had my first computer.</h3>
                    <h3>When I was at 9th standard I got interested in programming <br> and started developing windows app using visual basic.</h3>
                    <h3>During the vacation I went to Chennai. The trip enriched my skills <br> and learnt new things that were on the bucket list.</h3>
                    <h3>I was selected to the church choir.</h3>
                    <h3>I went for keyboard classes.But I only went for few classes and <br> learnt upto C minor. I told you that I was a fast learner <br> I learnt rest of the piano by myself(without using youtube or other tutorials).<br> How I did this was by practicing. I realized that the rest of the scale <br> was same but different home key. I am right now the keyboard player at my church and for a band.</h3>
                    <h3>I became good at drawing after the Chennai trip as <br> I went for drawing class and trained under a reputed artist in Chennai.</h3>
                    <h3>I learnt journalism when I was at Chennai. <br> I learnt how to frame news article. <br> The class was taken by a reputed English newspaper company.</article></article></h3>
                    <h3>During the stay at Chennai I learnt swimming. <br> I enrolled for a 14days course.

                    <h3>I had passed my 10th standard with 95% mark <br> and had 4.0 converted to GPA which is out of 4. <br> 10.0 in CGPA</h3>
                    <h3>During my 10th vacation,I went for a bridgecourse <br> as It will be boon for my academics. Because in Indian education system <br> there is a huge transition in the complexity of academics from 10th to 11th class. <br> 11th class contains a tough curriculum. Bridgecourse eased my transition.</h3>
                    <h3>I was made to attend medical batch, But I know I liked engineering,<br>I was bad at biology as I was bad at remembering things. <br> So I told my parents and joined computer science. Even though I joined late to computer science. <br>I was the best programmer. My computer science teacher used to say <br> I should go to a reputed engineering college and pursue computer enginnering <br> as I have a instinct for programming inborn.</h3>
                    <h3>During the 11th vacation I applied for research at IIT palakkad. <br> But they cancelled it due to the pandemic</h3>
                    <h3>I decided to improve my programming skills <br> so I attended courses from coursera and MIT opencourseware. and <br> earned a certificate from University of Michigan and google. <br> I got specialization in Python and machine learning using tensorflow.</h3>
                    <h3>My class for 12th started but was through zoom. <br> During that time I got an idea to digitilize education and <br> made a program using Python that collect answer from student and <br> compare the answer with the answer the database using Natural Language Processing <br> and give a score based on the answer. <br> This system was aimed to conduct online subjective exams</h3>
